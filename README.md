# Quarantine Engine (Vulkan version)
Quarantine Engine is a game engine under development using C++ and Vulkan. I started this project during the challenging quarantine we had to go through in 2020. At that time, I began developing it with OpenGL, and since then, I have continued to work on its development and improvement.

I am implementing this version of the engine in Vulkan, and my goal with it is to enhance my knowledge in various areas of real-time 3D graphics.


Below are some of the main features incorporated into Quarantine Engine (Vulkan version).

## Features

### GPU Animation system *(using compute shaders)*
