# Quarantine Engine (Vulkan version)
Quarantine Engine is a game engine under development with C++ and Vulkan, I started this [project](https://github.com/Trifido/QuarantineEngine) during the terrible quarantine we had to go through in 2020. At that time I started to develop it with OpenGL, and since then I have continued to develop and improve it.

More info about [Quarantine Engine](https://insidethepixels.wordpress.com/2021/01/18/quarantine-engine/).

This version of the engine I am implementing it on Vulkan, and my goal with it, is to improve my knowledge in different areas of real-time 3D graphics.


Some of the main features that have been incorporated to Quarantine Engine (Vulkan version) are listed below.

## Features
