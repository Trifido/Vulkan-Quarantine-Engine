# Quarantine Engine (Vulkan version)
Quarantine Engine is a game engine under development with C++ and Vulkan, I started this project during the terrible quarantine we had to go through in 2020. At that time I started to develop it with OpenGL, and since then I have continued to develop and improve it. 

This version of the engine I am implementing it on Vulkan, and my goal with it, is to improve my knowledge in different areas of real-time 3D graphics.


Some of the main functionalities that have been incorporated to Quarantine Engine are listed below.
